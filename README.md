# BookmyTrip - Travel Ticketing System

***a Basic program developed to demonstrate Ticket Booking systems, developed during my early days with C++ programming as a High school stud, this was a major project throw me out to push my limits as a programmer!***

## Initial Work (October '14 - March '15)

Basic idea is to obtain Customer Details like Name, Date of Birth, Phone Number, eMail Address (potenially to implement a User Profile in later developments) and List of Passengers and their details.

Post obtaing Customer Data - the flow moves to Ticket Booking, where we list a set of Cities for Origin (Depature) and Destination (Arrival) and Fare Calculation based on choices opted.

Optional Menu - where Customer is Offered to Book Hotel Accomodation that are nearby to their Travel Destination

Intially developed version lacked to feature to Cancel to Bookings Made and the Fares were Fixed (not dynamic)

this Project was an effort with my Dear Friend - [Ganesh D. Dolia](https://www.instagram.com/ganeshdolia/)

# Post Project-Period Development (2021 - Present)

Back in 2021, I found this Gem of my High School - taking me back to those Days of Intense Coding, Search for Ideas and Code Help over the Internet.

I decided to continue working this side-by-side with my Work, and I was out-of-blue to coding when I started - all being completly out of touch with Coding for almost 2yrs.

So, I decided to 3 things to do :

1. To upgrade and re-make the [Original C++ Code](https://github.com/abhinavbharadwajr/bookmytrip/tree/main/project.cppfol/oldmain.cpp) to lastest C++ Standards (C++11 and above)

2. To re-make this Project in Java and Python - that wat to increase the Code base and Learn them both Totally from Scratch.

3. To make a Web-app of the Same - which unfortunetly I won't be able to, since there is already a Website under the Name ***["BookmyTrip"](https://www.bookmytrip.co/)***
